                                Adam is an independent ecologist focused on gall inducing organisms in North America. He
                                co-founded Gallformers.org as a community resource to help naturalists identify gall observations
                                and to collect information on undescribed galls. His primary focus is on adding literature and
                                information to the Gallformers database.

                                Jeff is a Software Engineer who stumbled upon galls and became obsessed. So much so that he
                                co-founded this site, wrote all the code for this site, and is responsible for keeping it going,
                                fixing it, and implementing new features, and paying the bills. If the site is broken, it is most
                                likely his fault. He is also way too into Oaks and will soon start building an ID tool for them.
