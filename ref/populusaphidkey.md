description: 'A key to the aphid galls on Populus in North America'
author: Adam Kranz

*This key is a synthesis of gall descriptions given in the literature. There is reason to believe that these gall descriptions may not map perfectly onto monophyletic aphid taxa; cases where this is known to be true will be noted but the full extent of variation for all species is likely not known, and cryptic species likely await description.*

## Populus Sections

| **Section**     | **Species**                                                   |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Aigeiros**    | *deltoides*, *fremontii*, *nigra*                             |
| **Populus**     | *alba*, *tremula*, *tremuloides*, *grandidentata*              |
| **Tacamahaca**  | *angustifolia*, *balsamifera*, *tristis* (= *trichocarpa*)    |

## Notes

> **Note:** *Populus tremula*, *alba*, and *nigra* are non-native species found in cultivated settings.

> **Caution:** Some galls may require DNA or anatomical evidence to distinguish between closely related species.

## The Key

### 1. Leaves folded into loose “nest.”

No galled tissue, leaves often not even curled, aphids exposed along the petioles causing them to shorten and bend together. Only on *Populus tremuloides*:

[Pachypappa rosettei](https://www.gallformers.org/gall/4012)

---

### 2. Gall on stem, dropping late in the season leaving a flat circular scar

Slit opening usually aligned with stem rather than perpendicular to it. On Sect. Tacamahaca and Aigeiros:

[Pemphigus populiramulorum](https://www.gallformers.org/gall/3459)

             In spring. Typically on Sect. Tacamahaca; apparently the same species on *Populus fremontii*: stem mother  
             [Thecabius populimonilis](https://www.gallformers.org/gall/4009)

             [Thecabius gravicornis](https://www.gallformers.org/gall/4010)

           - **One to four rows of bead-like galls parallel to midrib or (on *Populus fremontii*) along the edge of the leaf, each containing a single winged or apterous aphid.**  
             In summer. Often in numbers, overtaking the whole leaf and causing it to spiral. Typically on Sect. Tacamahaca.  
             Apparently the same species forms similar galls on *Populus fremontii* but this may be worth confirming:

       - **Gall on midrib**

                - **Similar, typically found on the upper leaf per early lit but Foottit et al 2010 state that this aphid was found predominantly in galls on the lower side. A third, undescribed taxon was also reported on similar galls:**
